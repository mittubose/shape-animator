# make the tasks for development

split it into phases

Here's how you can split the development of your Interactive Animation and Prototyping Platform into manageable phases with logically grouped tasks. Each phase ensures incremental value and frequent feedback, making the development transparent and adaptable.

# Development Task Breakdown by Phases

## **Phase 1: Project Foundation \& Core Animation**

- **1.1 Planning \& Design**
    - Define user personas, user journeys, and usage scenarios.
    - Create wireframes and UI mockups for the main panels.
    - Finalize technology stack and key architecture decisions.
- **1.2 Set Up Codebase**
    - Initialize frontend (React.js/Vue.js) and backend (Node.js/Python, if needed).
    - Set up project repositories, version control, CI/CD pipelines.
- **1.3 Basic Animation Editor**
    - Implement basic Canvas for drawing/importing shapes (rect, circle, polygon, SVG).
    - Build Timeline panel with keyframe support (position, scale, opacity).
    - Add real-time preview and timeline scrubbing.
- **1.4 Export MVP**
    - Implement basic export to Lottie JSON.
    - Set up import/export of project files for iterative editing.


## **Phase 2: States, Transitions, \& Prototyping**

- **2.1 State Machine System**
    - Design data models for states and transitions.
    - Develop a visual state machine editor (drag-and-drop logic, transition graph).
    - Add triggers: click, hover, load.
- **2.2 Component \& Prototyping Tools**
    - Enable creation of components and variants (states per component).
    - Allow nesting/reuse of components and prototyping screens/frames.
    - Implement frame linking and navigation (go to frame, overlays).
- **2.3 Advanced Timeline Controls**
    - Multiple tracks/layers per component.
    - Custom easing, durations, and delays for transitions.


## **Phase 3: Responsive, Interactivity \& Cloud Export**

- **3.1 Responsive Animation \& Layout**
    - Implement constraints and fluid sizing for responsive design.
    - Add breakpoint support and testing for different devices.
- **3.2 Real-Time Interactivity**
    - Mouse-follow, cursor-based, drag/scroll triggers.
    - Support for variable/conditional animation triggers.
- **3.3 Enhanced Export Capabilities**
    - Add export to GIF, MP4 (backend/cloud render pipeline).
    - Export preview panel (file size, format options).
    - Support background transparency, resolution selection.


## **Phase 4: Collaboration, Templates \& Usability**

- **4.1 Collaboration Tools**
    - User authentication (OAuth, SSO).
    - Real-time multi-user editing with cursor presence.
    - Comment threads and sidebar.
- **4.2 Templates, Libraries, \& AI**
    - Library for reusable components, triggers, animation templates.
    - Preset libraries for rapid prototyping.
    - AI/prompt-based shape and animation generation (if included in V1).
- **4.3 Usability Enhancements**
    - Undo/redo, history stack.
    - Drag-and-drop trigger and linking system.
    - Accessibility (keyboard navigation, screen reader support).
    - Responsive UI/device preview mode.


## **Phase 5: Testing, QA, Docs \& Launch**

- **5.1 Comprehensive Testing**
    - Unit/integration tests.
    - Cross-browser/device QA.
    - Performance and load testing.
- **5.2 Documentation \& User Support**
    - Comprehensive user guides and in-app help.
    - API documentation (if relevant).
- **5.3 Deployment \& Launch**
    - Finalize hosting, set up monitoring.
    - Launch MVP.
    - Provide post-launch support and collect feedback for further improvement.


## **How to Use These Phases**

- Start with **Phase 1** to deliver a working animation editor with basic export and editing.
- Each subsequent phase builds on the previous, prioritizing core usability and gradually layering in more complex functionality.
- Split each phaseâ€™s tasks into sprints or iterations based on team size and velocity.
- Always ensure demoable progress at the end of each phase for user feedback.

If you'd like, I can help convert these into a visual Gantt chart or sprint board structure for your workflow or project management tool. Let me know!
