# Project Requirements Document

**Interactive Animation and Prototyping Platform (Inspired by Phase, Rive, Spline, and Figma)**

## 1. **Project Overview**

Develop a web-based platform for designing, animating, and prototyping 2D shapes and UI components. Users can easily create interactive animations, define logic and transitions, preview in real time, and export to formats such as Lottie, GIF, and MP4. The tool will combine state-of-the-art usability features from modern tools like Rive and Spline, with a focus on seamless workflow, collaboration, and real-world integration.

## 2. **Core Features \& Improvements**

### 2.1. **Animation \& State Management**

- **Timeline Editor**
    - Visual, timeline-based animation editing for layers and keyframes.
    - Multiple tracks per component (transform, opacity, color, custom properties).
    - Real-time scrubbing, editing, and preview.
- **State Machines (Like Rive)**
    - Visual creation of animation states (e.g., default, hovered, pressed, disabled, custom states).
    - Drag-and-drop state machine editor for defining logic and transitions.
    - Triggers: click, hover, drag, on load, data/event input, mouse follow, more.
    - Custom easing, duration, delay for every transition.
    - Advanced trigger builder for compound or conditional logic.
- **Responsive Layouts \& Breakpoints**
    - Animation scales or adapts to screen/device size using constraints and/or breakpoints.
    - Fluid/relative sizing and animation—automatic adjustment for mobile/web use.
- **Real-Time Interactivity**
    - “Mouse follow” and cursor-based triggers (axis/distance-based reactions).
    - Component reactions to scroll, drag, or variable changes.


### 2.2. **Prototyping \& Components**

- **Component System**
    - Reusable, nestable components with their own state logic/animations.
    - Variant support (like Figma)—multiple states and transitions per component.
    - Hot-swappable/prototyping: components can be replaced or triggered in prototypes.
- **Prototyping Workflows**
    - Connect frames/screens visually for demo flows, overlays, modals, and navigation.
    - Frame linking: “go to”, “open overlay”, “swap main UI”, etc.


### 2.3. **User Collaboration \& Workflow**

- **Real-Time Multi-User Collaboration**
    - See live cursors, editing, and comments from team members (like Google Docs/Figma).
    - Feedback/commenting threads directly on components or timeline. (Basic implementation complete)
    - Version history and project autosave.
- **Templates, Libraries, \& Reusability**
    - Libraries for reusable components, animation patterns, triggers, and design assets. (Basic implementation complete)
    - Template and preset effect library for fast project start and design consistency.


### 2.4. **Export \& Integration**

- **Multi-Format Animation Export**
    - Export to Lottie JSON (.json), dotLottie (.lottie), GIF, MP4, PNG, WebM.
    - Interactive/embeddable runtime export (like Rive/Spline)—not just static media.
    - Set resolution, background transparency, preview file size pre-export.
- **Project Import/Export**
    - Save/open project files for iteration and sharing. (Implemented)
    - Import shapes, SVGs, or assets from design tools.


### 2.5. **Workflow \& Usability Enhancements**

- **AI/Prompt-Based Creation (Inspired by Spline AI)**
    - Users can describe desired shapes or motions and generate base animations via natural language.
- **Seamless State Transitions**
    - Crossfade/blend smoothly between states.
    - Allow transition interruption and override.
- **Advanced Preview \& Testing**
    - Real-time preview, timeline scrubbing, interactive trigger simulation, device/mobile view modes.
- **Drag \& Drop Interactions**
    - Build interactions by dragging connectors, linking states, setting up triggers without code.
- **Undo/Redo, History, Import/Export**
    - Full editing history and easy import/export for iterative design.


## 3. **UI/UX Requirements**

- **Main Canvas:** Central workspace for composing scenes/frames.
- **Timeline Panel:** Bottom; for animating and managing keyframes and transitions.
- **Component/Layer Panel:** Left; hierarchically visualize and organize components.
- **Inspector Panel:** Right; attribute editing, triggers, state logic.
- **Prototyping Links:** Visual connectors/overlays for navigation between frames or states.
- **Export Panel:** Format/size options, live preview, and asset download.
- **Commenting/Collaboration:** Integrated side panel for live feedback and team communication.


## 4. **Technical Requirements**

- **Frontend:** React.js or Vue.js, animation powered by libraries such as Lottie-web/Rive-web.
- **Backend (if required):** Node.js/Python (Flask/FastAPI), persistent storage (MongoDB/PostgreSQL), auth (OAuth, SSO).
- **Export:** Cloud rendering for MP4/GIF, in-browser for Lottie; leverage cloud pipelines for performance.
- **Hosting:** AWS, GCP, Vercel, or Netlify.
- **Security / Performance / Scalability:** Secure storage, performant previews, and support for concurrent teams and exports.
- **Accessibility:** Keyboard navigation, screen reader support, colorblind-friendly UI.


## 5. **Milestones \& Deliverables**

1. Design \& user journey/wireframes
2. Timeline and state machine prototype
3. Animation, prototyping \& transition editing
4. Component/component library \& responsive animation integration
5. Lottie/GIF/MP4 export (static \& interactive formats)
6. Real-time collaboration \& version control
7. Cloud rendering, multi-platform testing
8. Preset/template libraries, AI-powered prompt tools
9. QA, documentation, launch MVP

## 6. **Success Criteria**

- User animates, customizes, and exports complex, interactive components in <15 minutes.
- Team collaborates live with no data loss or bottlenecks.
- Responsive, accessible, and consistent outputs across export formats.
- Seamless integration with modern web/dev app ecosystems.


## 7. **(Optional Advanced) V2+ Feature Ideas**

- Marketplace for community/shared templates and assets.
- Audio/voice support, 3D elements, or mobile-native apps.
- Analytics for prototype usage/testing.

This document consolidates all base features from Phase, advanced usability enhancements and workflows borrowed from Rive/Spline, and addresses end-to-end modern animation/prototyping needs for individuals and teams.
