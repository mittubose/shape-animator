# Task 1.1: Planning & Design

**Phase:** 1
**Status:** In Progress

## Sub-tasks:

- [x] Define user personas, user journeys, and usage scenarios.
- [x] Create wireframes and UI mockups for the main panels.
- [x] Finalize technology stack and key architecture decisions.

## User Personas

### UI/UX Designer (Priya)
- **Goal:** Create interactive prototypes and animations for web and mobile apps.
- **Needs:**
    - Easy-to-use interface.
    - Integration with design tools (Figma, Sketch).
    - Detailed control over animation properties.
    - Ability to create and manage animation states.

### Frontend Developer (David)
- **Goal:** Implement complex animations efficiently.
- **Needs:**
    - Clean, production-ready code export.
    - Lightweight runtime/library.
    - Easy integration with modern frontend frameworks (React, Vue.js).
    - Clear documentation.

### Marketing Professional (Maria)
- **Goal:** Create simple, engaging animations for social media and marketing.
- **Needs:**
    - Low learning curve.
    - Pre-made templates.
    - Easy export to common formats (GIF, MP4).

## User Journeys

### Priya (UI/UX Designer)
1.  **Import:** Imports design assets from Figma.
2.  **Compose:** Arranges elements on the canvas.
3.  **Animate:** Uses the timeline to create keyframe animations.
4.  **State Management:** Creates states like "hover" or "pressed".
5.  **Transitions:** Defines transitions between states.
6.  **Preview:** Previews the interactive animation.
7.  **Export:** Exports the animation as a JSON file for the developer.

### David (Frontend Developer)
1.  **Receive:** Gets the animation JSON from the designer.
2.  **Install:** Installs the animation library in the project.
3.  **Integrate:** Imports and renders the animation component.
4.  **Connect:** Links animation states to application logic.
5.  **Test:** Verifies the animation in the application.

### Maria (Marketing Professional)
1.  **Select:** Chooses a pre-made template.
2.  **Customize:** Modifies text, colors, and images.
3.  **Adjust:** Fine-tunes animation timing.
4.  **Preview:** Views the final animation.
5.  **Export:** Exports the animation as a GIF.

## Wireframes & UI Mockups

Based on the provided reference images, the UI will consist of the following main panels:

### 1. Top Toolbar
- **Content:** Shape creation tools (rectangle, circle), selection tool, text tool, undo/redo buttons, export button, and zoom controls.

### 2. Layer Panel (Left)
- **Content:** A hierarchical view of all elements on the canvas, including screens, groups, and individual shapes. Allows for selecting, hiding, and locking layers.

### 3. Canvas (Center)
- **Content:** The main drawing area where users create and manipulate shapes. Includes rulers and guides.

### 4. Inspector Panel (Right)
- **Content:** Displays and allows editing of properties for the selected element, such as position, size, color, and animation properties.

### 5. Timeline Panel (Bottom)
- **Content:** A timeline with a playhead, keyframes, and animation properties for each layer. Allows for creating and editing keyframe-based animations.

### 6. Export Popup
- **Content:** A modal window for configuring export settings, including format (JSON, GIF, MP4), frame rate, and quality.

## Technology Stack & Architecture

- **Frontend Framework:** React
- **Canvas Rendering:** `react-konva`
- **Styling:** `styled-components`
- **State Management:** React Context API (for now)
- **Architecture:** Component-based architecture with a main `Editor` component that manages the state of the canvas, timeline, and inspector panels.
