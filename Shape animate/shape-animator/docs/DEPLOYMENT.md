# Deployment Guide

This guide provides instructions for deploying the Shape Animator application.

## Building for Production

To create a production-ready build, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `build` directory with the optimized and minified files.

## Deployment

You can deploy the contents of the `build` directory to any static hosting service, such as Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.
